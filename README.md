# machine-learning-and-deep-learning
This repository contains few codes portofolio in the field of Machine Learning. Contains code:
- MNIST prediction: a computer vision deep learning model using PyTorch that can predict MNIST dataset
- Bank Resignment: Trying out a few classification model with sci-kit to predict resignment using Bank HR data.
- Clustering Data: Trying out clustering model with sci-kit using dummy numerical data.
